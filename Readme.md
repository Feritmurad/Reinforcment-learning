# Project Overview

This repository contains:
    - **Assignment 1** 'Bandits-Reinforcement-Learning' folder.
    - **Assignment 2**: 'Tabular-Reinforcement-:earning-in-an-MDP' folder.
    - **Applied Project**: 'Project' folder.

## Project Structure

### 1. **population methods**
This directory contains implementations of population methods with various hyperparameter settings. The filenames describe the specific configurations used in each method.

### 2. **zeroth order**
This directory contains implementations of zeroth-order Optimization with different configurations. The filenames reflect specific hyperparameters used in the implementation.


- **main.py**: This is the main entry point of the project.
- **plot.py**: A script for generating plots and visualizations based on the results.
- **policy_evaluation.py**: Contains functions for evaluating policies derived from the zeroth-order optimization or population methods.
- **Policy.py**: Defines the policy structure and functions utilized in the experiments.
- **population_methods.py**: This file contains the core implementation of the population methods algorithm.
- **zeroth_order.py**: This file contains the core implementation of the zeroth-order algorithm.


## Usage
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the experiment.
4. Use `plot.py` to visualize results.
5. Refer to `Project.pdf` for detailed documentation and explanations.
